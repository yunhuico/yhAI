# linkerWebConsole
This sub repo contains Dockerfile, golang binaries and config files for container **linkerrepository/linker_webconsole**, 
which provides web shell support for Linker DCOS.

# Compose
The docker compose configure is in [docker-compose-user.yml][3]

# ENV
Required environment variables are listed below.

**SWARW_ENDPOINTS**: Comma separated endpint of swarm master.
Example:
SWARW_ENDPOINTS=52.78.88.104:3376,52.78.18.255:1234

# Volume
No cert file was copied to the container, mount a directory containning **ca.pem** **cert.pem** **key.pem** 
from host to **/usr/local/bin/certs** in container when start a new one.

Example:
```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:10022 -v /linker/docker/sysadmin/cluster3/certs:/usr/local/bin/certs linkerrepository/linker_webconsole
```

# Gotty TLS
Different from certs for docker daemon or swarm, gotty use seperate certification files.
`gotty.crt`, `gotty.ca.crt` and `gotty.key` are certs for gotty.

To enable secure websocket connection for gotty, simply clone this repo and

1. fullfill gotty.crt, gotty.key and gotty.ca.crt
2. switch option `enable_tls` to true in `gotty.conf`
3. build image locally and push it to a PRIVATE registry

If no private registry available, `docker save` and `docker load` image manually, and restart container manually.

**NEVER PUSH ANY CHANGES OF CERTIFICATION FILES TO GITHUB!**

**NEVER PUSH IMAGE CONTAINING CERTIFICATION FILES TO DOCKERHUB!**
